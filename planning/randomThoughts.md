# Moderators
- get detailed info on past sessions, specific session, players history, their bans and kicks (both used and recieved)

# Sessions
- ? ping only for players with lvl 2 endorsement or higher?

# Templates
- ? Should have an option to select "latest" as version and automatically update for latest MC version


# Players
- endorsement level starts at 1, only decays at 3 or above?

# Feedback
- ?! Same template code == same feedback?
	- no, you can have multiple of the same feedback types, but it should be based on the session, not the feedback itself
- ? Should feedback be able to set required questions?

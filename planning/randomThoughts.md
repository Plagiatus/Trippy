# Moderators


# Sessions


# Templates
- ? Should have an option to select "latest" as version and automatically update for latest MC version


# Players


# Feedback
- ?! Same template code == same feedback?
	- no, you can have multiple of the same feedback types, but it should be based on the session, not the feedback itself
- ? Should feedback be able to set required questions?
